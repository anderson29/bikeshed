.SH NAME
1 .. 9, NF \- awk and print a column (based on the name of the program, 1-9)

.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "1 [SEPARATOR]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fB1\fP is a simple script that conveniently splits and prints a given column, where the column to print is the name of the script program you're running (1-9).  2-9 are symlinks to 1; their behavior simply changes based on the name called.

\fBNF\fP can be used to print the last field.

The program takes one optional argument, the input field separator (whitespace, by default).

.SH EXAMPLES
Rather than:
 mount | awk '{print $3}'

Try:
 mount | 3

Instead of:
 cat /etc/passwd | awk -F":" '{print $7}'

You can just do:
 cat /etc/passwd | 7 :

Or
 cat /etc/passwd | NF :
